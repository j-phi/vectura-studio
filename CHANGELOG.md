# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

The format is intentionally human-curated with an `Unreleased` section that collects work before release.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Repository operating-model scaffolding for a maintained punchlist, version synchronization, release-note discipline, and GitHub governance setup.
- A named universal-noise architecture direction, `Noise Rack`, with repo-level planning and documentation contracts.
- An initial shared Noise Rack runtime module in `src/core/noise-rack.js`.
- Noise Rack-powered stacked noise support for `Rings`, including per-noise projection, drift, and sample-radius controls.
- Noise Rack-powered stacked field support for `Topo`, including multi-layer height-field sampling.

### Changed
- Version handling now treats `package.json` as the canonical source, with `npm run version:sync` updating the runtime version module and visible app badge.
- Contributor and agent documentation now requires maintaining `plans.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, README release notes, and architecture diagrams alongside relevant changes.
- `wavetable`, `spiral`, and `rainfall` now share centralized noise-stack blend-combination logic instead of carrying separate inline implementations.
- `Rings` now uses a Noise Rack stack instead of a single bespoke noise panel.
- `Topo` now uses a Noise Rack stack instead of single global noise controls, with fractal settings living on applicable noise layers.

## 0.6.59 - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Replaced the remaining one-off Petalis modifier noise sliders with nested Noise Rack stacks in the main Petalis controls and the Petal Designer modifier cards.
- Kept legacy `scale` values as fallback zoom for older Petalis documents while routing new modifier edits through shared Noise Rack layer controls.

### Added
- Added deterministic unit coverage for Petalis modifier Noise Rack stacks.

## 0.6.58 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- A `Center Diameter` control for `Rings` so the innermost ring can start wider without changing the active Noise Rack stack.

### Changed
- Reworked `Rings` `Concentric` sampling so it behaves like a true ring-path field instead of a nearly static seam break, while keeping circular closure intact.
- Improved the Rings apply-mode help text so `Top Down`, `Concentric`, and `Orbit Field` describe the actual sampling models more clearly.

## 0.6.57 - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Fixed shared Noise Rack image controls so `Invert Color` is handled as a real checkbox in the stacked-noise UI.
- Corrected image `Noise Width` sampling direction across the affected samplers so larger values widen the field instead of narrowing it.
- Centered polygon noise by default in the remaining top-left-biased samplers, including `wavetable`, so polygon fields start from canvas center.

## 0.6.56 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- A Petalis `Drift Noise Rack` control stack so angular drift now uses the shared Noise Rack model instead of a single legacy scale slider.

### Changed
- Petalis radial-noise, circular-offset, petal-noise, filament, and drift sampling paths now evaluate through Noise Rack-compatible stack samplers while preserving current legacy parameters as fallbacks.
- Local Playwright smoke runs now patch unsupported Unicode regexes, fall back to an installed Chrome when managed Chromium assets are unavailable, and disable local failure-video capture while keeping CI video artifacts enabled.

## 0.6.55 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Noise Rack stack controls for `flowfield`, `grid`, and `phylla`, including per-layer engine selection, offsets, blend modes, and octave shaping.

### Changed
- `flowfield` now maps stacked Noise Rack fields into angle or curl flow while preserving its particle controls.
- `grid` and `phylla` now derive distortion from stacked Noise Rack fields instead of single ad hoc noise samplers.

## 0.6.54 - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Refined Rings apply-mode semantics so `Top Down` samples world-space XY noise, `Concentric` samples along each ring path length, and `Orbit Field` preserves the legacy ring-local field.

## 0.6.53 - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Updated Rings control language to describe the new `Top Down` and `Concentric` semantics ahead of restoring the legacy orbit-local mode as its own option.

## 0.6.52 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Topo Noise Rack migration with multi-noise height-field layering.

### Changed
- Preserved Topo contour mapping modes while moving meaningful fractal controls into per-noise-layer behavior.

## 0.6.51 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Rings Noise Rack migration with multi-noise layering and per-noise `Concentric` / `Top Down` projection.

### Changed
- Preserved legacy ring behavior through per-noise drift and sample-radius controls within the new Noise Rack model.

## 0.6.50 - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Canonical app-version plumbing through `src/config/version.js`.
- A version synchronization script at `scripts/sync-version.js`.

### Changed
- The app version shown in the UI now aligns with the package version.
