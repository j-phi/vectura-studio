# Plans

This file is the active repository punchlist. Update it whenever meaningful work starts, changes scope, or completes.

## Operating Rules
- Keep `Inbox`, `In Progress`, `Done`, and `Decisions` current in the same PR as the implementation.
- Move items instead of duplicating them when status changes.
- Record architecture-level decisions in `Decisions` so future work has a stable reference.

## In Progress
- Establish the repository operating model: canonical version sync, `CHANGELOG.md`, README release notes, expanded architecture diagrams, and Codex doc-maintenance rules.
- Add GitHub governance scaffolding: structured issue forms, Dependabot, CODEOWNERS, release-note categorization, and documented GitHub Project / ruleset expectations.
- Design the universal multi-engine noise system, named `Noise Rack`, so all noise-capable algorithms converge on one stack model.
- Continue extracting shared Noise Rack runtime primitives; stack blend-combination logic is now centralized, with deeper sampler extraction still pending.
- Extend Noise Rack to the remaining direct consumers, now mainly Petalis per-modifier stack UI parity and any leftover bespoke samplers.

## Inbox
- Extract more shared Noise Rack runtime primitives from the duplicated `wavetable` / `spiral` / `rainfall` implementations into `src/core/noise-rack.js`.
- Extend explicit per-modifier Noise Rack UI stacking to Petalis center and petal modifier cards so modifier noise layers can be layered interactively instead of only via runtime-compatible stack data.
- Add tests for Noise Rack determinism, serialization, UI normalization, and algorithm parity across migrated systems.
- Add GitHub-side rulesets / branch protection, merge queue, and Project fields once the repository settings are available to configure.
- Decide whether to gate PRs on lint after introducing a repo-wide ESLint config that is compatible with the current browser-IIFE codebase.

## Done
- Added an agentic harness source-of-truth document and synchronized PR-template expectations.
- Added baseline automated test coverage for unit, integration, e2e smoke, visual, and perf workflows.
- Established existing Mermaid-based architecture documentation in the README.
- Built an advanced stacked-noise foundation in `wavetable`, with related layered-noise behavior already present in `spiral` and `rainfall`.
- Added the first shared Noise Rack runtime primitive in `src/core/noise-rack.js` and wired shared blend-combination behavior into `wavetable`, `spiral`, and `rainfall`.
- Migrated `rings` to Noise Rack with stacked noise layers, preserved ring-local drift/sample-radius controls, and per-noise `Orbit Field` / `Concentric` / `Top Down` projection.
- Migrated `topo` to Noise Rack with stacked field layers while preserving the existing contour mapping modes and moving fractal controls into per-noise-layer settings.
- Migrated `flowfield`, `grid`, and `phylla` onto Noise Rack stacks while preserving their algorithm-specific master controls.
- Routed Petalis drift and the existing noise-driven Petalis modifier samplers through Noise Rack-compatible stack evaluation, and restored local Playwright smoke runs with a system-Chrome fallback plus local video suppression.
- Fixed shared image-noise control behavior by rendering `Invert Color` as a checkbox, correcting `Noise Width` direction in the affected samplers, and centering default polygon noise in the remaining off-center algorithms.
- Reworked `Rings` `Concentric` mode into a seam-corrected ring-path sampler, improved the apply-mode help text, and added a `Center Diameter` control for widening the innermost ring.

## Decisions
- `Noise Rack` is the product and architecture name for the universal multi-engine noise stack.
- `Universal` means every current noise-capable algorithm, not only new features and not only `wavetable`.
- `package.json` is the canonical app version source. Sync derived version surfaces with `npm run version:sync`.
- `README.md`, `plans.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the visible app version, and any affected in-app help/shortcut text are part of the required documentation surface for meaningful feature work.
- In `Rings`, `Top Down` means a universal world-space XY field beneath the artwork; `Concentric` means seam-corrected path-space sampling around each full ring loop; `Orbit Field` preserves the legacy ring-local orbital sampler.
